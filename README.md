Scripts for the algorithms described in the paper 
``Key Recovery from Gramâ€“Schmidt Norm Leakage in Hash-and-Sign Signatures over NTRU Lattices'' 
by Pierre-Alain Fouque, Paul Kirchner, Mehdi Tibouchi, Alexandre Wallet, and Yang Yu. 
They show that how to recover ff* + gg* from Gram-Schmidt norms of a NTRU trapdoor basis. 
With ff*+gg*, one can recover the secret key (f, g) in poly-time. 

In ".\exact recovery", we provide the codes of the algorithms in Section 5.
In ".\noisy recovery",  we provide the codes along with experimental data for concrete attacks against DLP scheme.
